The components and evolution of various fish scales is a comprehensive field of research. There is however a gap in knowledge of the evolutionary developmental origin of the skeletal tissues involved in scale development. The bony scales of teleosts derive from mesodermal mesenchyme, an embryonic tissue that has been extensively known to contribute to skeletal development in vertebrates. However, the dentinous scales of sharks, a relatively older lineage of fishes, derive from *trunk* neural crest cells, which is an anomaly to developmental biology because skeletal tissues have only been known to derive from mesodermal mesenchyme and from *cranial* neural crest cells!
These are the only fishes in which the developmental origin of their scales have been determined. BUT there are thousands of fish species, both extinct *and* living. 
This information yields many questions and hypotheses: 
Is trunk neural crest skeletal contribution an ancestral character state that was lost over evolutionary time? Did the trunk neural crest or mesodermal mesenchyme contribute to scale development in primitive fishes? 
Considering the ancestral character state of scale composition relative to developmental origin, I hypothesize that the trunk neural crest embryonic origin of skeletal tissue was an ancestral character state that was lost over evolutionary time, leaving mesodermal mesenchyme as the sole primordial tissue to scales in derived fishes. I also hypothesize that all dentinous scale types of fossil fishes derived from the trunk neural crest.

To reconstruct likelihood of scale developmental origin states at each node within a fish phylogeny, I will conduct a Maximum Likelihood ancestral character state reconstruction using Mesquite using a constrained tree topology based on Qiao et al. (2016), Hughes et al. 2018, and Peng et al. 2007. 


I will be scoring the composition of various fish scales in various extant and extinct fossil fishes. Composition will include mesodentine, metadentine, semidentine, orthodentine, acellular bone, cellular bone, ganoine, enamel, cosmoine, etc. I will also score potential developmental origins of the scales, which is either of mesoderm or trunk neural crest. Data sources for character states will be obtained from Sire et al. (2009), and Janvier (1996).
I hypothesize that the phylogeny will show that trunk neural crest scale contribution is an ancestral character state that is lost in fishes that do not possess postcranial dentinous structures, and that mesoderm scale contribution is a synapomorphy for derived non-dentinous scales in crownward fishes.
